           <p>Are you a chicken nugget fan? Or maybe you have one in the family? 
            I feel you! Chicken nuggets are life, and I was obsessed for the first
             half of my life. Okay maybe more. Chicken nuggets are one of those 
             foods that seems like youd never be able to make them with real foodâ€¦ 
             think again! These sweet potato chicken poppers are the real food, adult version of the chicken nuggets that I loved for years!</p>
